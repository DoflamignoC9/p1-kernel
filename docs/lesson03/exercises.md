## Exercises

1. Change the reset value of TVAL so that the timer fires roughly every 1 sec. How can you determine such a value and show your solution is correct? 

2. Trigger an exception at EL1, handle it at EL2, and return to EL1. 

   In a paragraph, describe the exception you plan to trigger, what EL2 exception handlers you will implement, and how to demonstrate your implementation correctness. 

   Modify the kernel source to implement the behavior.
